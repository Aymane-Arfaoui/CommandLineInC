Command Line Arguments


** Purpose and Learning Outcomes:**
- Getting your environment setup (the virtual machine)
- Getting you use to coding in C.
- Understanding how to utilize command line arguments which we use in all upcoming assignments.
- Using the Linux terminal
- Understanding paths
- Using git and Github

 
- All projects are done in C in the Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine.
- Code must be neat, with proper and consistent indentation and well documented. 
- Keep line to around 80 characters per line, and not line greater than 100 characters.
- Comments must describe the logic and reason for the code and not repeat the code.  
- Variables must have meaningful names and be in a consistent format (I do not care if you use camelCase or under_scores in variables but be consistent.
- You must use `make` to compile the program.
- You must use `make run` (sometimes with RUNOPTIONS) to execute the program.
- In addition, each file must have the standard header as defined below.
- All source files and writeup must be in the main branch of the github.
  
All primary filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>_HW<#>_<component>.<proper extension>`, except Makefile.

Each .c and .h file must have a standard header as defined below.  Make sure to put in your section number (replace the #), your name, your student ID, a proper project name, GitHub name, filename, and description of the project.  Do not alter the number of asterisks and ensure that the header starts on line 1 of the file.
